from wbb import app # This is bot's client
from wbb import app2 # userbot client, import it if module is related to userbot
from pyrogram import filters # pyrogram filters
...


# For /help menu
__MODULE__ = "Module Name"
__HELP__ = "Module help message"


@app.on_message(filters.command("start"))
async def some_function(_, message):
    await message.reply_text("I'm already up!!")

# Many useful functions are in, wbb/utils/, wbb, and wbb/core/
```

And put that file in wbb/modules/, restart and test your bot.
